# Django To-Do-List

This is just an example of a todo list using Django. 
This app is not in production hence the reason i have not hidden the 'secrets', this serves as an example of what a CRUD application looks like.
This links to an external Database, and efficently relays updates back and forth depending on the user commands.
I hae also used unit testing to test each application.
